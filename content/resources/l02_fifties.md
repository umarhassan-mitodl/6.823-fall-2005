description: 'This resource discusses the importance of technology, technology is
  the dominant factor in computer design, computers in mid 50?s, programmer?s view
  of the machine IBM 650, earliest instruction sets, programming: single accumulator
  machine, processor-memory bottleneck: early solutions, index registers, support
  for subroutine calls, recursive procedure calls and reentrant codes, evolution of
  addressing modes, and data formats and memory addresses.'

This resource discusses the importance of technology, technology is the dominant factor in computer design, computers in mid 50?s, programmer?s view of the machine IBM 650, earliest instruction sets, programming: single accumulator machine, processor-memory bottleneck: early solutions, index registers, support for subroutine calls, recursive procedure calls and reentrant codes, evolution of addressing modes, and data formats and memory addresses.
